# 30-days-of-css

This is a project from Milena Carecho next to some youtube channels (Online Tutorials, Creative Creations, Dark Code) as references for the challenges.

In her repository, Milena created some rules as a suggestion:

â€¢ Carry out a new project every day (not necessarily for 30 days in a row)
â€¢ Do not repeat a project already created
â€¢ The project must be completed until 11:59pm
